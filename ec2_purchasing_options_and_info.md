**Dedicated Instances:**

### Additional Considerations and Services:

**Spot Fleet:**
Allows you to provision a collection of Spot Instances and optionally On-Demand Instances with a single request, simplifying the management of your Spot Instances.

**Auto Scaling:**
Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in a group based on demand or a predefined schedule, ensuring that you have the right number of instances to handle varying workloads efficiently.

**EC2 Fleet:**
Allows you to provision capacity across different EC2 instance types, Availability Zones, and purchasing options to optimize performance, availability, and cost.

**Managed Instance Hibernation:**
Allows you to hibernate EC2 instances, preserving the instance state, RAM contents, and data in attached instance storage. This is useful for scenarios where you want to maintain the current state of an instance while minimizing costs.
